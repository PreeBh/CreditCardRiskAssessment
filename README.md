# CreditCardRiskAssessment

Credit card Risk Assessment is a credit card holder's dataset containing their basic information as attributes and target variable as binary which tells that whether a customer 
will be able to pay the bills or not in the next month . I  have tried to solve this predictive analytical problem using Random Forest Regressor .
This problem is efficient in identifying the potential risks of credits on the banks and can be used to check the same for profitable functioning of the bank .
